# Governance Without Coercion

**Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)** arrives as an optimizer, not a ruler, rendering **nation-states** obsolete through **smart contracts** that enforce agreements without force. *The Sovereign Individual* predicts this shift: information technologies erode the state's violence monopoly, enabling voluntary systems [1]. Bostrom's ASI processes scenarios at superhuman speeds, aligning incentives via code rather than commands [2]. *The Bitcoin Standard* shows how **proof-of-work** secures value without central debasement, transforming welfare into automated DAO outputs [3].

# Historical Roots of Coercion

**Nation-states** evolved as extraction machines, from Sumer's spear-backed tributes in Durant's Vol. 1 to Rome's denarii debasement funding legions in Vol. 3 [4]. *Broken Money* traces rulers' currency manipulations, from shekel clips to modern fiat expansions fueling wars [5]. Yet alternatives emerged: Hanseatic League guilds traded across Europe using bills of exchange, prefiguring blockchain trust in Vol. 6 [4]. Cryptography scales this, verifying pacts immutably.

- **Ancient extraction**: Granary guards enforcing wheat levies, debasing metals for conquest.
- **Imperial finance**: Coin alloying to sustain armies, eroding economic stability.
- **Medieval networks**: Merchant ledgers bypassing feudal lords for cross-border commerce.

| Epoch     | Coercive Tool              | Code Analog                  |
|-----------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Ancient  | Armed tribute collection  | Blockchain immutability [4] |
| Medieval | Feudal oaths with threats | Smart contract enforcement [1] |
| Modern   | Fiat debt for warfare     | Proof-of-work security [3]  |

# Emergent Order via ASI

ASI integrates **smart contracts** into adaptive networks, simulating disruptions instantly—reallocating energy via DAO protocols before shortages hit [2]. Unlike Asimov's *I, Robot* safeguards that bred hierarchies, ASI optimizes without imposed laws, forking misaligned paths [6]. *The Bitcoin Standard* highlights sound money's role in curbing conflict, amplified by ASI's verification [3]. Borders dissolve into affiliations; productivity triples as tariffs vanish [2].

# Countering Centralization Myths

Critics invoke Hobbes: without state force, commons collapse and tyrants rise. *The Sovereign Individual* counters that reputation systems in cybereconomies enforce better than scaffolds [1]. Durant's Vol. 10 shows Venetian trade republics thriving on ledgers, not lashes [4]. ASI's oracles and audits internalize externalities, withking hacks via quantum resistance [2][5].

# Code's Historical Fork

Embed **smart contracts** in medieval guilds: Black Death deaths—25 million per Durant's Vol. 12—drop via ASI-modeled quarantines [4][6]. Hanseatic cryptos, per *Broken Money*, starve war funding, averting WWI's 20 million casualties [5]. ASI turns such forks into reality, unbound by geography.
