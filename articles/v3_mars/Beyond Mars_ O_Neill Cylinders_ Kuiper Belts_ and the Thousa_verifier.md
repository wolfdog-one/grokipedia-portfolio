## Overall Assessment
This draft is a solid synthesis of O’Neill-inspired concepts with modern extensions to Kuiper mining, but ~30% of claims are unverified or extrapolated beyond sources (e.g., specific numbers like 10^{23} kg or phase populations). Core physics and references hold up well, emphasizing scalability limits from delta-v, errors, and resources. For canonical Grokipedia, tighten unverified claims to "estimated" or remove; add mechanistic depth on replication kinetics (e.g., error propagation in Von Neumann machines via Markov models). Brutal honesty: Ambitious but overhyped—realistic timelines likely centuries, not decades, per thermodynamic bottlenecks.
