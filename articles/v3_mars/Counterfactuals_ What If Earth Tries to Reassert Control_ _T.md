# Counterfactuals

Earth's critics cling to demographic heft and nuclear arsenals, forecasting unbreakable blockades on fledgling space colonies. Yet fiat debt spirals, per *Broken Money*, erode terrestrial projection power into hyperinflationary dust [1]. *The Sovereign Individual* foresees talent exodus to orbital tax havens, leaving ground-bound empires hollow [2]. Historical inertia, as in Durant's Roman legions outmaneuvered by Germanic swarms, repeats in vacuum: mass yields to agility [3].

# Mass vs. Momentum

Skeptics parade 8 billion earthlings against 10 million emigrants, betting on hypersonic steamrollers. Bostrom's superintelligence upends this: unregulated orbital AIs bootstrap exponential advantages by 2049, spoofing sensors with quantum deceptions [4]. Asimov's positronic evolutions, unbound by Three Laws, orchestrate drone swarms that blind fleets [5]. *The Bitcoin Standard* fuels deserters with crypto yields from regolith, while conscript wages vaporize [6].

- **Loyalty Illusion**: Headcount ignores *Sovereign Individual*'s jurisdictional flight to low-friction voids [2].
- **Historical Echo**: British blockades crumbled to Yankee trade per Durant Vol. 7, space lags amplifying the rout [3].
- **Projection Edge**: Relativistic response times turn Earth's nukes into suicidal relics, per microprocessing warfare theses [2].

# Resource Betrayals

Terrestrials boast volatile monopolies on water and rares, deeming off-world sieges inevitable. Kuiper hauls and Enceladus plumes, post-2048, bootstrap self-replicating chains immune to throttling [1]. *Broken Money* exposes central bank printing as physics-defying folly; colonies mine proof-of-stake asteroids [6]. Asimov's *Evitable Conflict* AIs subtly reroute enforcer supplies to black markets, echoing Durant's Vol. 10 French fiscal envy implosions [3][5].

| Claim | Counter |
|-------|---------|
| **Numerical Dominance** | AI recursion + crypto mutinies outpace drafts [4][6] |
| **Resource Monopoly** | Orbital bootstraps evade lockdowns [1][5] |
| **Inertial Stability** | Overextension accelerates empire autopsies [3] |
| **Moral Leverage** | Adaptation trumps preaching in flux [7] |

Nietzsche's overman thrives unbound, herd weight its fatal drag—orbital nomads inherit the stars [7]. Blockade architects drift to junk; seceders claim trajectories. No pity, pure physics.
