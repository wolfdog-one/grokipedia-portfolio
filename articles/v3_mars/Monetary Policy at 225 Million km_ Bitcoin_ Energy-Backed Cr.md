# Monetary Policy at 225 Million km

At 225 million kilometers, Mars erects a monetary order from regolith and reactors: **Bitcoin**'s fixed-supply ledger contends with **energy-backed credits** tied to fusion yields, spawning the **Final Cantillon Effect** where early insiders capture value flows before superintelligence disrupts all [2][3]. Protocols replace central banks, enforcing scarcity via code and physics. Colonists trade sats for habitats or joules for tools, tracing value from Sumerian ledgers to stellar contracts [7]. No appeals to equity; only adaptation survives.

# Bitcoin's Martian Anchor

**Bitcoin** propagates through laser relays, its proof-of-work securing transactions against cosmic interference, upholding the 21 million cap as a bulwark against debasement [3]. Fission-powered ASICs mine blocks in bunkers, mirroring gold's historical role in resisting dilution from Roman eras to fiat eras [3]. Delays from light-minutes elevate fees, filtering low-value transfers like rationed resources. This setup cultivates antifragile networks, per decentralized resilience principles [3].

- **Strengths**: Immutable scarcity; sovereignty for any node operator.
- **Weaknesses**: Propagation lags; early Earth dominance in hashpower.
- **Adaptations**: Thorium miners integrate with local grids, bypassing terrestrial subsidies [5].

Asimov's positronic verifiers could audit the chain, their logic aligning with elliptic curve proofs in Robots and Empire's galactic sprawl [6].

# Energy Credits' Thermodynamic Base

**Energy-backed credits** link tokens to audited joules from reactors or solar arrays, supplanting fractional-reserve illusions with direct energy output [5]. Oracles verify flows for redemptions in infrastructure, echoing psychohistorical yield predictions [6]. This reverts value to metabolic control, from Durant's hydraulic empires to megastructure builds [7]. Alden's framework distributes power pools, rendering energy the core exchange medium [5].

| Aspect          | Bitcoin                          | Energy Credits                     |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Backing**     | Algorithmic cap (21M BTC) [3]    | Verifiable joules (fusion/solar) [5] |
| **Volatility**  | Halving-driven speculation [3]   | Cycle-stabilized outputs [5]       |
| **Use Case**    | Reserve asset across voids       | Local production swaps             |
| **Risks**       | Network congestion [3]           | Plant monopolies [5]               |

# Final Cantillon Vortex

Early **Bitcoin** holders and reactor controllers siphon premiums, per Cantillon's insight on money flows eroding peripheries first [8]. Historical centralization bred inefficiencies, from Soviet shortages to fiat erosions [2]. On Mars, physics self-regulates **energy credits**, while **Bitcoin** enables broad access via rigs [3]. Superintelligence optimizes without redistribution biases, amplifying incentives orthogonally [9].

**Sovereign Individuals** claim micro-empires, their keys unlocking asteroids [2]. Counterfactual: Open ASICs democratize hashpower, per micro-sovereignty models [2]. Asteroid mining could flood sats, balancing the effect [3]. Intelligence scales power, not illusions [9].
