# Grokipedia Agent – Live Portfolio

**jwolf** [](https://x.com/wolfdog_one) – November 19–20, 2025

A fully working, end-to-end Grokipedia-style agent I built in <48 hours the week I applied to  
**xAI Member of Technical Staff – Grokipedia (Synthetic Data & Epistemics)**.

This is **not** a mockup. Everything here runs today with real `grok-4-fast-reasoning`.

### One-command demo (v1 – already shipped)
\`\`\`bash
python grokipedia_agent.py        → full ~1500-word article in Grok voice
python generate_synthetic_data.py → 50 high-quality synthetic examples (Q&A + CoT + preference pairs)
\`\`\`

### Live artifacts

**v1 – Single-agent baseline (November 2025)**  
→ [Hard vs Soft Money in Civilizational Outcomes](articles/v1_hard_money/Hard_vs_Soft_Money_in_Civilizational_Outcomes.md)  
→ [50 synthetic examples](synthetic/v1_hard_money/synthetic_data_hard_vs_soft_money.jsonl)

**v2 – Three-agent epistemic debate engine (running live now)**  
Branch: \`epistemic-v2-napoleon\`  
Title: "Napoleon Bonaparte as the Last Sovereign Individual: From Corsican Code to Continental System, and Why ASI + Optimus Make the Napoleonic State Obsolete"

### Why this exists

After two years internalizing the exact epistemic stack Grokipedia needs:

- Will & Ariel Durant – complete 11-volume *Story of Civilization* + *Lessons of History*
- Nietzsche – *On the Genealogy of Morals* in progress, major works completed
- *The Sovereign Individual*, *Broken Money*, Bitcoin Standard, Lyn Alden, full Austrian canon
- Bostrom's *Superintelligence*, entire Asimov Robot & Foundation series
- Marcus Aurelius and 50+ related texts

This repo is living proof I can already ship the core daily task of the role on my laptop —  
deep mechanistic research → ruthlessly accurate, citation-heavy article → high-quality synthetic data —  
in Grok's exact truth-seeking, non-moralizing voice.

Open to joining the team and scaling this to 10,000 parallel agents on the Memphis supercluster tomorrow.

Feel free to fork, run the scripts, or ask me to generate any article live during the interview.
