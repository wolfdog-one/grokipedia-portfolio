# Grokipedia Agent – Live Portfolio

**James Jacoban** (@wolfdog_one) – November 19–20, 2025

A **fully working, end-to-end Grokipedia-style agent** I built the week I applied to xAI Member of Technical Staff – Grokipedia (Synthetic Data & Epistemics).

This is not a mockup. Run one command and it generates a publish-ready Grokipedia article + 220+ training examples using **Ray + real Grok-4-fast-reasoning**.

### One-command demo

```bash
python3 grokipedia_agent.py
