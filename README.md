# Grokipedia Agent – Live Portfolio

**James Jacoban** [](https://x.com/wolfdog_one) – November 19–20, 2025

A fully working, end-to-end Grokipedia-style agent I built in <48 hours the week I applied to  
**xAI Member of Technical Staff – Grokipedia (Synthetic Data & Epistemics)**.

This is **not** a mockup. Everything here runs today with real Grok-4-fast-reasoning.

### One-command demo (v1 – already shipped)
```bash
python grokipedia_agent.py        → full ~1500-word article in Grok voice
python generate_synthetic_data.py → 50 high-quality synthetic examples (Q&A + CoT + preference pairs)
Live artifacts
v1 – Single-agent baseline (November 2025)
→ Hard vs Soft Money in Civilizational Outcomes
→ 50 synthetic examples
v2 – Three-agent epistemic debate engine (generating live right now)
Branch: epistemic-v2-napoleon
Title: “Napoleon Bonaparte as the Last Sovereign Individual: From Corsican Code to Continental System, and Why ASI + Optimus Make the Napoleonic State Obsolete”
Why this exists
After two years internalizing the exact epistemic stack Grokipedia needs:

Will & Ariel Durant – complete 11-volume Story of Civilization + Lessons of History
Nietzsche – On the Genealogy of Morals in progress, major works completed
The Sovereign Individual, Broken Money, Bitcoin Standard, Lyn Alden, full Austrian canon
Bostrom’s Superintelligence, entire Asimov Robot & Foundation series
Marcus Aurelius and 50+ related texts

This repo is living proof I can already ship the core daily task of the role on my laptop —
deep mechanistic research → ruthlessly accurate, citation-heavy article → high-quality synthetic data —
in Grok’s exact truth-seeking, non-moralizing voice.
Open to joining the team and scaling this to 10,000 parallel agents on the Memphis supercluster tomorrow.
Feel free to fork, run the scripts, or ask me to generate any article live during the interview.
