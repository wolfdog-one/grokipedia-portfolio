# Grokipedia Agent – Live Portfolio

**Anonymous applicant** [](https://x.com/wolfdog_one) – November 19–20, 2025

Fully working, end-to-end Grokipedia prototype built in <48 hours for the  
**xAI Member of Technical Staff – Grokipedia (Synthetic Data & Epistemics)** role.

This is **not** a mockup. Everything runs today with real `grok-4-fast-reasoning`.

### One-command demos

**v1 – Single-agent baseline (already shipped)**
\`\`\`bash
python grokipedia_agent.py        → full ~1500-word article
python generate_synthetic_data.py → 50 high-quality synthetic examples
\`\`\`

**v2 – Full epistemic engine (three-agent debate + verifier)**
\`\`\`bash
python generate_full_napoleon.py   → complete 8-section Napoleon article (~2500 words)
python generate_v2_synthetic.py    → synthetic examples from real debate+verifier traces
\`\`\`

### Live artifacts

**v1 – Hard vs Soft Money**
→ [Hard vs Soft Money in Civilizational Outcomes](articles/v1_hard_money/Hard_vs_Soft_Money_in_Civilizational_Outcomes.md)  
→ [50 synthetic examples](synthetic/v1_hard_money/synthetic_data_hard_vs_soft_money.jsonl)

**v2 – Napoleon as the Last Sovereign Individual (complete, live)**
→ [Full article – 8 sections, tables, verification reports](articles/v2_napoleon/FULL_Napoleon_as_Sovereign_Individual.md)  
→ Individual sections in `articles/v2_napoleon/`  
→ v2 synthetic data from debate traces in `synthetic/v2_napoleon/`

### Why this exists

Two years internalizing the exact stack required:
- Will & Ariel Durant – complete 11-volume *Story of Civilization* + *Lessons of History*
- Nietzsche – *On the Genealogy of Morals* in progress, major works completed
- *The Sovereign Individual*, *Broken Money*, Bitcoin Standard, Lyn Alden, Austrian canon
- Bostrom’s *Superintelligence*, entire Asimov Robot & Foundation series
- Marcus Aurelius and 50+ related texts

This public repo is living proof I can already ship the core daily task of the role on my laptop —  
deep mechanistic research → citation-heavy, truth-seeking article → high-quality synthetic data —  
in Grok’s exact non-moralizing voice, with full epistemic rigor (multi-agent debate + verifier).

Ready to scale this to 10,000 parallel agents on the Memphis cluster tomorrow.

Feel free to fork, run the scripts, or ask me to generate any article live during the interview.
