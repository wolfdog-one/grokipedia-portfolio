# Grokipedia Agent – Live Portfolio

**James Jacoban** – November 19–20, 2025

A fully working, end-to-end Grokipedia prototype built in <48 hours the week I applied to  
**xAI Member of Technical Staff – Grokipedia (Synthetic Data & Epistemics)**.

This is real, runnable code — not a mockup, not a fork, not a tutorial.

### v1 – Single-agent baseline (already shipped)
```bash
python grokipedia_agent.py        → full 1500-word Grokipedia article
python generate_synthetic_data.py → 50 high-quality synthetic examples (Q&A + CoT + preference pairs)
Canonical articles & data

v1 (single-agent, November 2025)
→ Hard vs Soft Money in Civilizational Outcomes
→ 50 synthetic examples
v2 (three-agent epistemic debate engine with full traces)
→ Generating right now on branch epistemic-v2-napoleon
→ Topic: “Napoleon Bonaparte as the Last Sovereign Individual” (Durant + Nietzsche + ASI/Optimus lens)

Why this exists
After two years internalizing the exact epistemic stack the role demands:

Will & Ariel Durant – complete 11-volume Story of Civilization + Lessons of History
Nietzsche (Genealogy of Morals in progress)
The Sovereign Individual, Broken Money, Bitcoin Standard, Lyn Alden, Austrian canon
Bostrom’s Superintelligence, full Asimov Robot & Foundation series
Marcus Aurelius and 50+ related texts

This repo is living proof I can already ship the core daily task of the role on my laptop — deep mechanistic research → ruthlessly accurate article → high-quality synthetic data — in Grok’s exact voice.
Ready to scale this to 10,000 parallel agents on the Memphis cluster tomorrow.
Feel free to fork, run the scripts, or ask me to generate any article live during the interview.
